This project automates the deployment and monitoring of a Flask based subdomain enumeration web app on Kubernetes. The web app displays enumerated subdomains, their status, and associated IPs (if available/active). Docker containerization ensures portability, and Kubernetes manages scaling. A Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, triggered by pushes to GitHub, automates the process of building Docker images, pushing them to a registry, and deploying them to Kubernetes. Prometheus and Grafana provide real-time monitoring of application and cluster health. This setup streamlines deployments and improves reliability, offering efficient application management.
